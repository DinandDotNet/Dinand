									<h1>Micro Portal project</h1>
									<p>All-in-one medical portal with a suite of tools for collecting and analyzing blood results.<br/>
										One point of contact for healthcare providers to push, analyze and receive results from a reliable service.</p>

                                     Collect the results of different brands of microlabs sending their measurements to the main system.<br/>
                                     The program checks the results after verifying the status of the microlab. All results are stored in a central storage system. <br/>
                                     The logged in user is the user of the microlab. It is crucial to check the results, the status of the results and receive the approval back.

                                    <h5>X-tracked</h5>
                                    Various suppliers of blood measurements, such as laboratory, micro-analysis systems, send their results to this system to store them in the main system.
                                    Summary and checksums confirm that the results have been successfully received and saved.<br/>

                                    <h5>Debriever</h5>
                                    All results are analyzed and assessed. Add advice and warnings to the results.<br/>
                                    <div class="image main"><img style="width:28%" src="images/Database.jpg" alt="" /></div>
                                    <h5>Result portal</h5>
                                    A website that gives you the results of stored blood values, depending on the purpose.
                                    New results are featured since the last visit.
                                    The result can be exported in various formats to suit client care systems.<br/>
                                    <div class="image main"><img style="width:28%" src="images/Z-Analyse.jpg" alt="" /></div>
                                    
                                    <h5>Z-Analyse</h5>
                                    This system analyzes the history of the data to create a logical timeline by displaying the fluctuations.
                                    This can be on one or more records to produce information for imaging of medical personnel, sales, methods used, etc.</p>

                                <h5>Architecture</h5>

                                <p>The application runs on separate hosted servers in different places on the internet.<br/>
									This bullet list is an overview of the decisions made within the project.</p>
									<ul>
										<li>By creating a read service to read from the storage, and a separate write service to write to the storage, we spread the network load as much as possible.</li>
										<li>Primarily connected to a security service, all communication is secured by default (such as SSL and standard security protocols) and whitelisting, as well as custom secured with unique codes that are only known to the sender and receiver</li>
										<li>An OAuth2 user security covers the front-end security. While this security at the back communicates with a unique key pair every time, it protects hacking from within to other caregivers.</li>
										<li>By keeping all plugins and technologies used at a basic level, it prevents problems after upgrading. Therefore, any extensions are built outside of the default modules, and the log tells their problem for troubleshooting.</li>
										<li>Modular/microservice usage prevents complex codestrokes in a large app. Takes less effort for maintenance. Can easily switch to external or internal services.</li>
		                                <li>All applications are written in .net 6 or newer, and will be upgraded to any new LTS version.</li>
										<li>The services are redundantly distributed over multiple overload hosts with an uptime of more than 99%. The risk of failure is kept to the absolute minimum.</li>
									</ul>
